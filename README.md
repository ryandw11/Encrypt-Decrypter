# Encrypt-Decrypter
Just meant to be a fun project. This is not meant to be used as anything.

## Files
I only included the header and main cpp files. To put this in visual studio I recomend downloading this to a zip. Then create a new project in visual studios. Replace the cpp file that was created with the one you downloaded. Then pop in the header files in the header section and you're good to go.

More information available on the wiki.
